# Blue Compact Case for 803040 Bat

This is a slightly modified version of the original case to use a larger battery.

## Why

Made for larger 803040 Li-Po battery that was easier to purchase in the EU when I was looking for batteries.

## Features

- Support for 803040 Li-Po that is larger (1000mAh vs 800mAh)
- Support for default SlimeVR recommended Amazon Trilancer straps (5cm vs 4cm)
- More compact 3mm case top (1mm less in height)

## Assembly guide

- Print the case (USBC and USBC+AUX variants)
- Print the 3mm case top lid (those cases have 1mm less height)
- (optional) Print the holders for 5cm Trilancer straps if you have them (measure your straps!)

Everything else stays the same.
