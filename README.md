# SlimeVR-CheeseCake
Very delicious Cheesecake. Designed by Sorakage

# OverView
"CheeseCake" is a Lighter, portable and better looking full body tracking device.   
Based on SlimeVR   
With 8-port charging dock, eliminating wiring troubles.   
# CAUTION：   
**Before flashing the firmware, the board must be connected to the battery.**    
This design removes the protection diode, and USB5V is supplied to the battery via the on-board charging chip TP4057.    
The on-board charger will not output voltage without connected to the battery.
